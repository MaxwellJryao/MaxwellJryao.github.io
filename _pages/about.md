I am a first-year PhD student in Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), with a great fortune to be supervised
by Prof. <a href='https://tongzhang-ml.org/'>Tong Zhang</a>.

I obtained a bachelor's degree of engineering (B.Eng.) from <a href='https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/'>Yao Class</a>, <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/'>Tsinghua University</a>. 

My current research interests focus on reinforcement learning, large language models, especially autonomous agents learning and the interdisciplinary fields.
